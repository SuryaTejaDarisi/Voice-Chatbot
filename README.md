## Implementation
Initially, let's set up a virtual environment.
### 1. Setting up a Virtual Environment
To create an environment:
```
python -m venv <env_name>
```
To access it:
```
<env_name>\Scripts\activate
```
To deactivate it:
```
deactivate
```

### 2. Installing required Libraries
This repo contains a requirements.txt file which contains all the python libraries required.
```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

### 3. Working on Code
Just run the last code cell in the notebook for testing.
```
main()
```
The file website.py contains code for hosting the website publicly.


### P.S.
This project can't be executed in Colab as it doesn't support a Mic. So, one can only run this locally.
